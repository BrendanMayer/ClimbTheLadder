- right now i have ID's and dependency IDS

the code should:
- Check if a task has a dependency ID not equal to 0
- find the dependency Task with the same ID
- assign it to a random NPC --
- have a check to see if the dependency has been completed before the main task is able completed (bool?)--
- only allow the random dependency task to be given by the npc is if has been mentioned through the main
 task first (tell chatgpt to never talk about it unless specifically asked about it)
- chatgpt should return a different tag for completed dependency tasks.
- tasks should be cleared from the NPC after completion so it is not given twice, also include context
which tells chatgpt to forget that task.
- needs to be cleared from the possible tasks list to prevent same task given twice from a different NPC
when random task assignation is made.
